# KVM with NVIDIA GPU and Audio Passthrough Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) with NVIDIA GPU and audio passthrough on an Ubuntu 20.04 host. The virtual machine was configured to directly access the host’s GPU and audio hardware, enabling high-performance tasks such as gaming, video editing, or AI workloads. After the virtual machine was used, all configurations were removed, and the host system was restored to its original state, ensuring no residual impact on the host’s functionality.

## Goals
- Configure a KVM virtual machine with NVIDIA GPU passthrough for direct hardware access.
- Set up audio passthrough to enable the virtual machine to use the host’s audio hardware.
- Blacklist the NVIDIA driver on the host to ensure the GPU is available for passthrough.
- Use the virtual machine for testing or running GPU-intensive applications.
- Remove all KVM configurations and restore the host system to its original Ubuntu 20.04 state.

## Project Journey
The project was executed through a series of well-defined phases, reflecting a structured approach to virtualization and system management:

### Preparation and Host Configuration
- Selected an Ubuntu 20.04 host equipped with an NVIDIA GPU.
- Blacklisted the NVIDIA driver on the host to prevent it from claiming the GPU, ensuring it was available for passthrough to the virtual machine.

### KVM Setup
- Installed and configured KVM on the host system.
- Created a virtual machine with settings optimized for GPU and audio passthrough.

### GPU and Audio Passthrough Configuration
- Configured the virtual machine to directly access the host’s NVIDIA GPU using PCI passthrough.
- Set up audio passthrough to allow the virtual machine to utilize the host’s audio hardware.

### Using the Virtual Machine
- Launched the virtual machine and verified that both GPU and audio passthrough were functioning correctly.
- Performed tasks within the virtual machine, leveraging the passed-through hardware for enhanced performance.

### Cleanup and Restoration
- Shut down the virtual machine.
- Removed all KVM configurations, including the virtual machine and related settings.
- Unblacklisted the NVIDIA driver on the host and restored the system to its original state, ensuring full functionality within Ubuntu 20.04.
